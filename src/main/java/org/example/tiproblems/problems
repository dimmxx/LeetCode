341. Flatten Nested List Iterator



Coding Task 1: Core Java (20 mins)
Q: (Java 8 Stream) Find the word that has the largest length amongst all the words present in the String
String test = "Welcome to the EPAM Interview process";



Coding Task 2: Problem-solving(30 mins)
Q: (Array) Find the length of the largest continuous subarray whose sum is equal to the given targetSum value.

int[] arr = {15, 4, -2, 2, -3, 1, 3, 3, 0};
int targetSum = 4;
4 ==> len 1
4, -2, 2 ==> len 3
-3, 1, 3, 3 ==> len 4
-3, 1, 3, 3, 0 ==> len 5
-2, 2, -3, 1, 3, 3, 0 ==> len 7
1, 3 ==> len 2
output: Max length is 7











Coding Task 2: Problem-solving(30 mins)
1. Given an integer sorted arrays a1 and a2, return array a3 which is sorted and comprises all the elements from a1 and a2

Input
a1 = [2, 9, 10]
a2 = [5, 7, 20]

Output
a3 = [2, 5, 7, 9, 10, 20]






    Coding Task 1: Core Java (20 mins)
    Given a sentence find the word that has the 2nd (Nth) highest length.
    “My Name is Samhita and I am a software engineer”
    Coding Task 1: Candidate's Solution
    Samhita has attempted the above practical task and almost completed successfully.
    Used split() method to break the string into Array.
    Pass the array into Collections.sort to sort the array with word length.
    Return the Nth element from sorted array.




    Coding Task 2: Problem-solving(30 mins)
    Problem Statement: We need to perform the performance testing on Microservice A which is handling 1000 RPM in production. There is one java code written which can trigger maximum 100 RPM.
    How can we optimize and setup the performance testing using java code to achieve at least 1000 RPM?
    Hint - Using Multi-threading and thread pool concept.
    Coding Task 2: Candidate's Solution
    She tried and mentioned that she has worked on thread pooling concept previously, but she could not re-collect the previous experience and explain it.
